# R Programming
These are my programming assignments while attending the Johns Hopkins University / Coursera ["R Programming"](https://class.coursera.org/rprog-016) course.

### Projects
##### Programming Assignment #1 - Air Pollution:
For this first programming assignment you will write three functions that are meant to interact with dataset that accompanies this assignment.
The dataset is contained in the zip file specdata.zip.

##### Programming Assignment #2 - Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

##### Programming Assignment #3 - Hospital Quality:
See the file "rprog-doc-ProgAssignment3.pdf" inside the Assignment 3 directory for more information about this assignment.
